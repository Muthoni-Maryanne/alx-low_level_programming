**Task 1:** [1-compiler](https://github.com/Muthoni-Maryanne/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler)-  Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link. The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE. The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .o instead of .c.
Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.o

**Task 2:** [2-assembler](https://github.com/Muthoni-Maryanne/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/2-assembler)- Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file. The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE. The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.
Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.s
