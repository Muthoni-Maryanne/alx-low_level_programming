**0x03. C - Debugging**

The concepts discussed in this include: what is debugging?, the process, techniques e.g tracing, interactive, acticity, post morterm, remote, wolf fence algorithm etc.,, anti-debugging and rubber duck debugging.

The resources used for learning are: 

1). [Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging)

2). [Rubber duck debugging](https://www.thoughtfulcode.com/rubber-duck-debugging-psychology/)

The tasks done to test the concept are:

**Task 0:** []() is a function that test whether a number is negative or positive.

Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

You are not coding the solution / function, youâ€™re just testing it! However, you can adapt your function from 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Task #0 to compile with this main file to test locally.

You only need to upload 0-main.c and main.h for this task. We will provide our own positive_or_negative() function.
You are not allowed to add or remove lines of code, you may change only one line in this task.
