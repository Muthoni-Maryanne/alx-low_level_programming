**0x03. C - Debugging**

The concepts discussed in this include: what is debugging?, the process, techniques e.g tracing, interactive, activity, postmortem, remote, wolf fence algorithm etc., anti-debugging, and rubber duck debugging.

The resources used for learning are: 

1). [Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging)

2). [Rubber duck debugging](https://www.thoughtfulcode.com/rubber-duck-debugging-psychology/)

The tasks done to test the concept are:

**Task 0:** [positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/Muthoni-Maryanne/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/positive_or_negative.c)  is a function that tests whether a number is negative or positive.

Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function [positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/Muthoni-Maryanne/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/positive_or_negative.c) gives the correct output when given a case of 0. You are not coding the solution/function, youâ€™re just testing it! 
You only need to upload 0-main.c and main.h for this task. We will provide our own positive_or_negative() function but one can create a custom one. How main.h should look and compilation with gcc:
